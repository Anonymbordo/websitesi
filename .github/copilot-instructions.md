# AI Assistant Instructions for Website Project

This document provides essential context for AI assistants working with this codebase.

## Project Overview

This is a simple website project that currently contains basic JavaScript functionality. The project is in early stages with minimal implementation.

## Project Structure

```
websitesi/
├── deneme.js     # Main JavaScript file with core functionality
└── README.md     # Project documentation in Turkish
```

## Development Conventions

1. **Language**: 
   - Code comments and variables should use Turkish naming conventions
   - User-facing content is in Turkish
   - Documentation is primarily in Turkish

2. **Project Setup**:
   - The project uses a simple structure with direct JavaScript files
   - No build tools or bundlers are currently implemented
   - Files can be run directly in a browser

## Key Files and Their Purpose

- `deneme.js`: Contains the core JavaScript functionality, currently implementing a basic "Hello World" alert
- `README.md`: Contains project setup and contribution guidelines in Turkish

## Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/yeni-ozellik`)
3. Make changes
4. Commit with descriptive messages in Turkish
5. Push to your fork
6. Create a Pull Request

## Future Considerations

When suggesting changes or additions:
- Maintain Turkish language consistency in code and documentation
- Keep implementation simple and direct
- Document any new functionality in the README.md
- Follow the existing minimal structure unless requirements change
